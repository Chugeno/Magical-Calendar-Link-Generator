# Magical Calendar Link Generator

[**🔗 Click here to use the tool**](https://chugeno.github.io/Magical-Calendar-Link-Generator/)

A simple web interface to generate, test, and copy **Agical.io** links.

## What is this?
This tool helps you create links that, when clicked, automatically download an `.ics` calendar file. It is powered by **[Agical.io](https://ics.agical.io/)**, a service that generates these calendar files dynamically based on URL parameters (like subject, time, location, etc.). 

Useful for newsletters, emails, or websites where you want a "Add to Calendar" button without hosting files yourself.
